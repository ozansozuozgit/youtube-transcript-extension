## How It Works

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the downloaded folder
5. The extension will now be installed and ready to use

## Settings

Click the extension icon in your toolbar to access settings:

- **AI Models**: Choose your default AI provider
- **Auto-Paste**: Enable/disable automatic pasting into AI interfaces
- **Custom Prompts**: Customize the summary prompt template
- **Language**: Change the prompt language (English, Spanish, French, German)
- **Theme**: Toggle between light and dark mode

## Testing the Extension

1. After installing, navigate to any YouTube video with captions (e.g., educational videos, lectures, tutorials)
2. Look for the "ü§ñ Summarize with AI" button next to the share/save buttons
3. Click it and select your preferred AI model
4. A new tab will open with the AI service, and the prompt will be copied to your clipboard
5. Paste the prompt (Ctrl/Cmd+V) into the AI chat interface

## Technical Implementation

The extension uses a two-part approach to extract YouTube transcripts:

1. **Primary Method**: Extracts the transcript URLs directly from YouTube's player response data
2. **Fallback Method**: Uses YouTube's caption API endpoints with multiple language fallbacks

For auto-pasting, the extension:
1. Detects which AI provider website is open
2. Uses site-specific selectors to locate the input field
3. Automatically pastes the transcript and optionally submits the form
